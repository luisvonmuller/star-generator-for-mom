    I'think Arc Is enought because...

    The type Arc<T> provides shared ownership of a value of type T, allocated in the heap. I
    nvoking clone on Arc produces a new Arc instance, which points to the same allocation on the heap as the source Arc,
    while increasing a reference count. When the last Arc pointer to a given allocation is destroyed,
    the value stored in that allocation (often referred to as ‚Äúinner value‚Äù) is also dropped.
    Shared references in Rust disallow mutation by default, and Arc is no exception: you cannot generally obtain a mutable reference
    to something inside an Arc.
     If you need to mutate through an Arc, use Mutex, RwLock, or one of the Atomic types.
